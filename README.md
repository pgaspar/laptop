Laptop
======

Laptop is a script to set up an OS X laptop for Rails development.

Requirements
------------

We support:

* [OS X Mavericks (10.9)](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/os-x-mavericks/id675248567)
* [OS X Yosemite (10.10)](https://www.apple.com/osx/)

Older versions may work but aren't regularly tested. Bug reports for older
versions are welcome.

Install
-------

Read, then run the script:

    bash <(curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pgaspar/laptop/master/mac) 2>&1 | tee ~/laptop.log

Debugging
---------

Your last Laptop run will be saved to `~/laptop.log`. Read through it to see if
you can debug the issue yourself. If not, copy the lines where the script
failed into a [new GitHub
Issue](https://github.com/thoughtbot/laptop/issues/new) for us. Or, attach the
whole log file as an attachment.

What it sets up
---------------

* [Bundler] for managing Ruby libraries
* [Heroku Config] for local `ENV` variables
* [Heroku Toolbelt] for interacting with the Heroku API
* [Homebrew] for managing operating system libraries
* [Homebrew Cask] for managing OS X apps
* [MongoDB] for storing document-based data
* [MySQL] for storing relational data
* [Rails] gem for writing web applications
* [Rbenv] for managing versions of Ruby
* [Redis] for storing key-value data
* [Ruby Build] for installing Rubies
* [Ruby] stable for writing general-purpose code
* [Zsh] as your shell
* [Sublime Text 3] as a decent code editor
* [iTerm 2] as a Terminal.app replacement

[Sublime Text 3]: http://www.sublimetext.com/3

Finally, Laptop will configure your default SSH key, if it is not setup.

It should take less than 15 minutes to install (depends on your machine).

Laptop can be run multiple times on the same machine safely. It will upgrade
already installed packages and install and activate a new version of ruby (if
one is available).

Make your own customizations
----------------------------

Put your customizations in `~/.laptop.local`. For example, your
`~/.laptop.local` might look like this:

    #!/bin/sh

    brew tap caskroom/cask
    brew install brew-cask

    brew cask install dropbox
    brew cask install google-chrome
    brew cask install rdio

You should write your customizations such that they can be run safely more than
once. See the `mac` script for examples.
